## Attribution
Hyperspace Lighting devices use a forked version of WLED. The native Home Assistant WLED integration worked with hyperspace lighting devices up to version `2024.7.4`. This repo is a copy of that `2024.7.4` WLED integration with additional changes. You can visit the [Home Assistant Core github](https://github.com/home-assistant/core) page for more information.


## Differences from stock 2024.7.4 WLED integration
- `manifest.json` 
    - `domain` changed so both the native WLED integration and this integration can co-exist without this one overriding core version.
    - `name` changed to match this integration.
- `const.py` - Updated domain to match manifest.
- `config_flow.py` - Only allows WLED devices whose `brand` is `Hyperspace`. This prevents standard WLED devices from being picked up by this integration.
- `strings.json` - Added new `abort_async` message for when non hyperspace devices are detected.
- Created as a HACS custom integration for convenience.
